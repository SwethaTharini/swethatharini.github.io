<h3>BELUM CAVES – A GLIMPSE INTO A DREAMY REALM</h3>

<p>Ever remembered the dreamy night from childhood after having a big day. It is full of sparkles and weird shapes, buildings and trippy locations. Feels like for an instance we transcended to another realm in our sleep. Even though scientifically they say we mostly forget our dreams, there are these unforgettable ones we've had that we still remember till today.</p>

<p>Oh! How we wished it never ended and kept thinking of it again and again. Sometimes we even wished to capture it with some advanced technology so that we could take it with us to the physical world. Well at times the real world is even more bewildering than the dream.</p>

<p>Places that look like it jumped out of a prodigy’s complex mind. Well if you want to experience it, pack up and head to Belum Caves in Andhra Pradesh.</p>

<p>The Belum caves is a natural cave formation in the Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh. It is the longest cave system in India extending upto 3229 meters and a depth of 151ft below ground. This cave system was formed as the result of erosion of the limestone deposit by the river Chitravathi.</p>

<p>Even though the cave system was discovered in the late 1800s the official recognition was done only after the German expedition in 1982–1983, after which it was declared as a protected zone.</p>

<p>Now, the Belum cave formation is a protected asset that is maintained by the Andhra Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation (APTDC).</p>

<p><strong>TRANSCENDENCE:</strong></p>

<p>Nestled under the agricultural lands, the entrance to the caves looks like a deep well that’s ready to take the plunge of a diver. Few steps further into the cave and you are already awe struck by the unbelievable formations of the underground world.</p>

<p>The long dark passages, clamouring echoes of the water, formations of stalagmite makes us feel an unbreakable sense of ataraxia.</p>

<p>Sliding our gaze gradually from the quartz crystal formations in the rocks, we reach the Simhadwaram (lion head shaped formation), an arch with the formation of stalactites that resembles the head of a lion.</p>

<p>The arch welcomes you to a spiritual trice as you come across the Kotilingalu (crore lingams) formations.</p>

<p>The stalagmite formations occurred in thousands of numbers, each resembling the shape of a Lingam.</p>

<p>We might think, how could this place be untouched by mankind for all these years even though it was formed millions of years ago.</p>

<p>Caves were always seen as a tranquil place or a portal to enlightenment by spiritual people.</p>

<p>You can see that the cave has been used by Buddhist and Jain monks centuries before as a meditation place.</p>

<p>Music is the vibe of the universe and underground caves do not need to always be silent and thrilling.</p>

<p>The Saptasvarala Guha (seven swaras cave) is a marvel formed by stalactites because when you hit it with a stick it doesn’t go “tick” like a normal rock, it goes “tiinnnnngg”.</p>

<p>At the deepest point lies the Pathalalinga, a stalagmite formation at 150ft, accompanied by an underground waterfall.</p>

<p>The depths of the earth are awaiting your visit.</p>
