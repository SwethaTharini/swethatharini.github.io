<h3>BELUM CAVES – A GLIMPSE INTO A DREAMY REALM</h3>
<p>Ever remembered the dreamy night from childhood after having a big day. It is full of sparkles and weird shapes, buildings and trippy locations. Feels like for an instance we transcended to another realm in our sleep. Even though scientifically they say we mostly forget our dreams, there are these unforgettable ones we've had that we still remember till today.</p>
<p>Oh! How we wished it never ended and kept thinking of it again and again. Sometimes we even wished to capture it with some advanced technology so that we could take it with us to the physical world. Well at times the real world is even more bewildering than the dream.</p>
<p>Places that look like it jumped out of a prodigy’s complex mind. Well if you want to experience it, pack up and head to Belum Caves in Andhra Pradesh.</p>
<p>The Belum caves is a natural cave formation in the Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh. It is the longest cave system in India extending upto 3229 meters and a depth of 151ft below ground. This cave system was formed as the result of erosion of the limestone deposit by the river Chitravathi.</p>
<p>Even though the cave system was discovered in the late 1800s the official recognition was done only after the German expedition in 1982–1983, after which it was declared as a protected zone.</p>
<p>Now, the Belum cave formation is a protected asset that is maintained by the Andhra Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation (APTDC).</p>
<p><strong>TRANSCENDENCE:</strong></p>
<p>Nestled under the agricultural lands, the entrance to the caves looks like a deep well that’s ready to take the plunge of a diver. Few steps further into the cave and you are already awe struck by the unbelievable formations of the underground world.</p>
<p>The long dark passages, clamouring echoes of the water, formations of stalagmite makes us feel an unbreakable sense of ataraxia.</p>
<p>Sliding our gaze gradually from the quartz crystal formations in the rocks, we reach the Simhadwaram (lion head shaped formation), an arch with the formation of stalactites that resembles the head of a lion.</p>
<p>The arch welcomes you to a spiritual trice as you come across the Kotilingalu (crore lingams) formations. The stalagmite formations occurred in thousands of numbers, each resembling the shape of a Lingam. Apart from the prominent formations you will also come across numerous shapes and patterns formed by the deposits, you can give them your own shape depending on how you perceive it.</p>
<p>We might think, how could this place be untouched by mankind for all these years even though it was formed millions of years ago. Caves were always seen as a tranquil place or a portal to enlightenment by spiritual people. You can see that the cave has been used by Buddhist and Jain monks centuries before as a meditation place.</p>
<p>Music is the vibe of the universe and underground caves do not need to always be silent and thrilling. The Saptasvarala Guha (seven swaras cave) is a marvel formed by stalactites because when you hit it with a stick it doesn’t go “tick” like a normal rock, it goes “tiinnnnngg”. At the deepest point lies the Pathalalinga, a stalagmite formation at 150ft, accompanied by an underground waterfall. The depths of the earth are awaiting your visit.</p>

<h3>A PRECIOUS TRINKET TO YOUR TRAVEL DIARY – EMERALD LAKE</h3>
<p>Like a sparkling precious stone to a beauty’s ears, this enticing offbeat location blinds away all the rumpus of a routine life with its magnificence. Rightfully named “Emerald”, this off-grid spot is hedged within the enthralling Western Ghats and adorned by clear emerald waters.</p>
<p>The fresh air from the opulent greenery and wide variety of flora and fauna is without any doubt an incredible sight. The place looks exceptionally striking during the early mornings and the evenings when the sky is kissed with peach and golden coloured clouds that look like delicious huge cotton candies floating above us.</p>
<p>Not to forget the lake that looks like an uncut piece of the precious emerald stone glistening in the daylight. Apart from the eye-catching scenic views there are also other fun activities like trekking, camping and bird watching activities arranged for the visitors.</p>
<p><strong>REACHING:</strong> You can visit the Emerald Dam and Lake any day of the week between 6 AM to 5 PM. There is no entry fee. One can reach Emerald dam through Bus or private vehicle by reaching Ooty and taking the Avalanche road. A brief drive of 25 km will bring you to the destination. Make sure you carry enough supplies like food, water, snacks.</p>
<p><strong>WHEN TO VISIT:</strong> Visiting during summer is best; monsoons and early September may have strong winds and downpours.</p>

<h3>A TAMPERED CROWN – DHANUSHKODI</h3>
<p>Clear blue waters gushing on all sides and the gentle waves singing melodiously. The distant sound of a jeep riding along a bumpy road with a dainty chatter of few people. Amidst the commingle of all these sounds is the dismal sight of a town in ruins that once flourished with a lively aura. Isolated in the southeastern tip of India, this small town has always been a visit that revokes our gratitude for being able to step out of our houses on a stormy day and not be consumed by the waters.</p>
<p>The Dhanush Kodi we see today is the remains of a town that was once a busy hub transporting goods and people to and from Sri Lanka and India. It continues to serve as a tourist spot helping the few fishermen families to continue their livelihood peacefully. Another surprising factor is that the town has a freshwater source for daily needs, with no saltiness.</p>
