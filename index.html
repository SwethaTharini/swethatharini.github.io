<h3>BELUM CAVES – A GLIMPSE INTO A DREAMY REALM</h3>
<p>Ever remembered the dreamy night from childhood after having a big day. It is full of sparkles and weird shapes, buildings and trippy locations. Feels like for an instance we transcended to another realm in our sleep. Even though scientifically they say we mostly forget our dreams, there are these unforgettable ones we've had that we still remember till today.</p>
<p>Oh! How we wished it never ended and kept thinking of it again and again. Sometimes we even wished to capture it with some advanced technology so that we could take it with us to the physical world. Well at times the real world is even more bewildering than the dream.</p>
<p>Places that look like it jumped out of a prodigy’s complex mind. Well if you want to experience it, pack up and head to Belum Caves in Andhra Pradesh.</p>
<p>The Belum caves is a natural cave formation in the Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh. It is the longest cave system in India extending upto 3229 meters and a depth of 151ft below ground. This cave system was formed as the result of erosion of the limestone deposit by the river Chitravathi.</p>
<p>Even though the cave system was discovered in the late 1800s the official recognition was done only after the German expedition in 1982–1983, after which it was declared as a protected zone.</p>
<p>Now, the Belum cave formation is a protected asset that is maintained by the Andhra Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation (APTDC).</p>
<p><strong>TRANSCENDENCE:</strong></p>
<p>Nestled under the agricultural lands, the entrance to the caves looks like a deep well that’s ready to take the plunge of a diver. Few steps further into the cave and you are already awe struck by the unbelievable formations of the underground world.</p>
<p>The long dark passages, clamouring echoes of the water, formations of stalagmite makes us feel an unbreakable sense of ataraxia.</p>
<p>Sliding our gaze gradually from the quartz crystal formations in the rocks, we reach the Simhadwaram (lion head shaped formation), an arch with the formation of stalactites that resembles the head of a lion.</p>
<p>The arch welcomes you to a spiritual trice as you come across the Kotilingalu (crore lingams) formations. The stalagmite formations occurred in thousands of numbers, each resembling the shape of a Lingam. Apart from the prominent formations you will also come across numerous shapes and patterns formed by the deposits, you can give them your own shape depending on how you perceive it.</p>
<p>We might think, how could this place be untouched by mankind for all these years even though it was formed millions of years ago. Caves were always seen as a tranquil place or a portal to enlightenment by spiritual people. You can see that the cave has been used by Buddhist and Jain monks centuries before as a meditation place.</p>
<p>Music is the vibe of the universe and underground caves do not need to always be silent and thrilling. The Saptasvarala Guha (seven swaras cave) is a marvel formed by stalactites because when you hit it with a stick it doesn’t go “tick” like a normal rock, it goes “tiinnnnngg”. At the deepest point lies the Pathalalinga, a stalagmite formation at 150ft, accompanied by an underground waterfall. The depths of the earth are awaiting your visit.</p>

<h3>A PRECIOUS TRINKET TO YOUR TRAVEL DIARY – EMERALD LAKE</h3>
<p>Like a sparkling precious stone to a beauty’s ears, this enticing offbeat location blinds away all the rumpus of a routine life with its magnificence. Rightfully named “Emerald”, this off-grid spot is hedged within the enthralling Western Ghats and adorned by clear emerald waters.</p>
<p>The fresh air from the opulent greenery and wide variety of flora and fauna is without any doubt an incredible sight. The place looks exceptionally striking during the early mornings and the evenings when the sky is kissed with peach and golden coloured clouds that look like delicious huge cotton candies floating above us.</p>
<p>Not to forget the lake that looks like an uncut piece of the precious emerald stone glistening in the daylight. Apart from the eye-catching scenic views there are also other fun activities like trekking, camping and bird watching activities arranged for the visitors.</p>
<p><strong>REACHING:</strong> You can visit the Emerald Dam and Lake any day of the week between 6 AM to 5 PM. There is no entry fee. One can reach Emerald dam through Bus or private vehicle by reaching Ooty and taking the Avalanche road. A brief drive of 25 km will bring you to the destination. Make sure you carry enough supplies like food, water, snacks.</p>
<p><strong>WHEN TO VISIT:</strong> Visiting during summer is best; monsoons and early September may have strong winds and downpours.</p>

<h3>A TAMPERED CROWN – DHANUSHKODI</h3>
<p>Clear blue waters gushing on all sides and the gentle waves singing melodiously for
forgiveness. The distant sound of a jeep riding along a bumpy road with a dainty chatter of
few people. Amidst the commingle of all these sounds is the dismal sight of a town in ruins
that once flourished with a lively aura. Isolated in the southeastern tip of India, this small
town has always been a visit that revokes our gratitude for being able to step out of our
houses on a stormy day and not be consumed by the waters. Our search for uncharted
adventure takes us to the town of Dhanushkodi which is around 20km from Rameshwaram
the Island town.</p>
  <p><strong>HOLDING ON TO LEGACIES :</strong>
<p>The Dhanush Kodi we see today is the remains of a town that was once a busy hub
transporting goods and people to and from Sri Lanka and India.
Some also say that when you stand at the very edge of the land you will be able to see
the Sri Lankan islands from there. Well, it could be because the island is just 31 km from
the town.
It is also the place where Lord Rama built the Rama Sethu with the help of Lord Hanuman
and his army to cross the sea and reach Ceylon (Sri Lanka). Some claim that the evidence
of the Rama Setu can be seen as a narrow stretch of submerged rocks from an ariel view.
Despite the heartbreaking catastrophe that destroyed the town in the year 1964, it
continues to serve as a tourist spot helping the few fishermen families to continue their
livelihood peacefully.
Another surprising factor is that the town has a freshwater source from where the locals
get water for daily needs. The interesting part is that the water doesnt have even a tiny
hint of saltiness even though it is originating from the salty sand beach surrounded all
sided by seawater. Sources claim that these water sources could be from natural aquifers.
Even though the town was stricken with natural calamities it still holds on to its legacies
singing the once happy and flourishing town’s praise in the tears of its ruins and beaches.</p>

<h3>A TROPICAL SNOWFLAKE</h3>
<p>What a beautiful composition of nature! So pure and so intricate. Soft yet invasive. Each tiny one
falls with a marvellous pattern. Snow is indeed one of the most dazzling occurrences in nature.
Unfortunately for some of us in the South, it is an impossible one to see. To experience the cozy
cold weather and catch a snowflake we have to travel all the way up to the foothills of the
Himalayas.
A minimum of 15,000 Rs for the trip, food and accommodations cost additional charges. Local
landscapes are concerning so you need to take a local cab. The trip needs at least a month of
planning and needs at least a week time for the entire trip to be completed. All this in mind yet our
heart’s longing for that tiny little snowflake to float from the heavens and fall into our hands.
With desperation in mind and hundreds of references later we stumbled upon a piece of good
news.
There is actually a place in South India that receives snowfall during the winters.</p>
  <p><strong>DELIGHTFUL VENTURES:</strong></p>
  <p>A long road trip across the country is definitely a breathtaking experience. But the facts
concerning the capital needed is always an obstruction. But why worry about it when you can visit
a winter wonderland within a few hours reach.
Lambasingi is a small village in Visakapattinam fondly called the Kashmir of Andra Pradesh due to
its cold weather and annual snowfall in the months of November and December. It lies 1025m
above sea level in the Chintapalli Ghats of Andra Pradesh. The dense deciduous forests covering the
village, scenic valley views accompanied by the teeth shuttering temperatures make this an offgrid adventure destination.
 The temperatures do not always drop below zero but there are few times when subzero
temperatures made Lambasingi a winter wonderland.
 Apart from these, there are also multiple adventure activities you can try out during your
visit to Lambasingi.
● Camping under the stars: What can be more delightful than sleeping under the canopy of
stars in a cozy tent. A warm cup of coffee and tales throughout the night before the bonfire
is an irreplaceable experience.
● Trek to off-grid adventures: Grab your backpacks and head for the Kotha Palli falls located
27km from Lambasingi.
● Fill your feed with beautiful pictures visiting the Tjangi reservoir. The turquoise water with
a backdrop of misty curls up the hills is an absolute eye delight.
So set a page aside to fill your winter diaries with a miraculous snowfall from a hill surrounded by
humid plains</p>
